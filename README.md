# csnFramework

Simple framework for determining best k for kNN in python.

# Datasets

To use put clean datasets in the datasets folder with the target value named 

# Built in optimisations

# Brute Force search

# Custom search

Based on the premise that the optimal k for kNN is sqrt(n) where n is number of instances for the dataset. The custom search allows for specifying the interval around sqrt(n) and brute force searching in that region.
