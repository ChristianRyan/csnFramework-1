# csnFramework

Simple framework for determining best k for kNN in python for the course in Machine Learning at Technical University Vienna.

# How to use

## Datasets

To use put clean datasets in the datasets folder with the target value named 'target'.

# Optimisation

## Grid search

## Randomized search

## Custom Local search

Based on the premise that the optimal k for kNN is sqrt(n) where n is number of instances for the dataset. The custom search allows for specifying the interval around sqrt(n) and brute force searching in that region.

## Binary search
